# vHPC

This project is meant to be a GUI visualization of local HPC environments based off virtual machines. 

The goal is to be able to create and manage nodes and manage networking. Similar to how you would manage a physical HPC cluster.
On top of that, having workspaces of different clusters, node templates and being able to share setups with others.
Its an amalgamation of Vagrant, GNS3 and OpenStack.

This is also a learning project for me to learn C and raylib. With that said, very much a work in progress.
